# Semantic Inpainting for Distributed Cross-Modal Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)

**Semantic Inpainting with Multi-Modal Sensory Data (e.g., Image + CSI)**  
This repository contains code and models for performing visual inpainting of occluded regions using deep learning, with a focus on leveraging auxiliary sensor modalities such as Wi-Fi CSI (Channel State Information).

---

## Features
### Semantic Inpainting with Occlusion Support
Robust inpainting from partially masked or occluded input data.

### Single- and Cross-Modal Compatibility
Works in both single-modality (e.g., image-only) and cross-modality (e.g., CSI-to-image) settings.

### Modular Architecture
Flexible design with the following pre-trained components:
- Semantic Encoder
- Semantic Inpaintor (Projection Layer)
- Versatile Decoders for Multiple Downstream Tasks
  Image Inpainting
  Future CSI Prediction
  Human Count Estimation
