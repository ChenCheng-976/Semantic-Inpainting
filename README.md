# Semantic Inpainting for Distributed Cross-Modal Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)

**Semantic Inpainting with Multi-Modal Sensory Data (e.g., Image + CSI)**  
This repository contains code and models for performing visual inpainting of occluded regions using deep learning, with a focus on leveraging auxiliary sensor modalities such as Wi-Fi CSI (Channel State Information).

---

## Features

- Semantic inpainting with partial or occluded inputs
- Support for singlemodal (e.g., image-only) and cross-modal setups (e.g., CSI-to-image)
- optional pretrained model backbone Semnatic Encoder-Semantic Inpaintor (projection)- vasertile Decoder for multiple downstream tasks architectures with optional pretrained model backbone
