# A Semantic Inpainting Framework for Distributed Cross-Modal Integrated Sensing and Communication

**Semantic Inpainting with Multi-Modal Data (e.g., Image + CSI)**  
This repository contains code and models for performing visual inpainting of occluded regions using deep learning, with a focus on leveraging auxiliary sensor modalities such as Wi-Fi CSI (Channel State Information).

---

## Features

- Semantic inpainting with partial or occluded inputs
- Support for image-only and cross-modal setups (e.g., CSI-to-image)
- Encoder-decoder architectures with optional pretrained ViT backbone
- Temporal smoothing and CSI fusion modules
- Visualization tools for input/output comparisons
