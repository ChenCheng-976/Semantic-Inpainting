# Semantic Inpainting Framework for Distributed Multimodal Intelligence

Welcome to the official page for our Semantic Inpainting project!

## Overview

This framework explores **distributed joint embedding predictive architectures** (JEPA) across cross-modal sensory inputs such as:

- Wi-Fi CSI sequences
- Camera imagery (RGB)
- LiDAR (planned)
- Trajectories (planned)

We propose a flexible, scalable, self-supervised inpainting engine to enable **modality-aware** and **resource-efficient** sensing and communication.
